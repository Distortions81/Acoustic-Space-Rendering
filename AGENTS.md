# Repository Contribution Notes

- Prefer concise, step-by-step setup instructions when documenting build or runtime dependencies.
- Keep package names and commands tailored to Ubuntu LTS releases unless otherwise noted.
- When listing installation commands, group related packages on the same `apt` line and include a short description of what the packages provide.
- Cross-reference the README when adding or modifying dependency instructions so the guidance stays consistent across files.
